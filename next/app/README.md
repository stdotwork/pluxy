# pluxy desktop app

The desktop app is the UI kit's second build ([`../ui`](../ui/README.md)), in a Tauri 2 window,
with a tray icon. It shows core's pages in the same places and with the same themes as the web
panel, then adds its own Connection page. Extension pages open in webviews of their own.

| Folder | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | The window: the kit's shell and pages, the app's host (`host.ts`), the Connection page, and how extension pages are drawn (`nativePage.tsx`) |
| `page/` | The small document an extension page's webview loads, which holds the page's sandboxed frame |
| `src-tauri/` | The native side: commands, the connection to core, the app's own core, extension page webviews, the tray |
| `native/` | The native test (`run.ts`) |

## How the app reaches core

The Connection page picks one of three modes. The app keeps the choice in `connection.json` in
its config folder (on Linux `~/.config/dev.pluxy.desktop/`), readable only by your user.

| Mode | What the app does | When the app quits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run core here (`managed`) | Starts the core program (`pluxy` beside the app, or one you name by full path) with a config of its own, `core/config.json` in the app's data folder. The first start writes that config with a free loopback port, which then stays the core's, new random keys, and folders for credentials and packages beside it. After that the file is yours to edit; the app only reads its `management_key`. | Stops that core (SIGTERM, then a kill after 10 seconds). On Linux the core also gets SIGTERM if the app dies without stopping it. |
| Core on this computer (`local`) | Connects to a core that already runs on a loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1` or `localhost`), such as a system service. You give its address and management key. | Leaves it running. The app never starts or stops it. |
| Remote core (`remote`) | Connects over https only, so the key is never sent in the clear. You can name a PEM file of certificate authorities to trust for that core, for a certificate you made yourself; without one, the usual public roots are used. The core's address is shown next to the app's name. | Leaves it running. |

Addresses are origins only (scheme, host and port). A key you give is checked against that core
(`GET /v0/management/status`) before the app switches to it. It is kept in `connection.json` only
when you tick "Keep the key on this device"; otherwise it lasts until the app quits.

The native side holds the management key. A key you type on the Connection page passes through
the window once, to the native side, and the window keeps no copy; the managed core's key never
reaches any webview, and no extension page ever gets a key. The window calls core through the
`core_call` command, and the native side adds the key and sends the call to
`<core>/v0/management/...` only, following no redirects and, for a core on this computer, no
proxy from the environment. Path segments that are, or decode to, `.` or `..` are refused.

Until the app is connected and signed in, the window shows only the Connection page, so a wrong
address or key can always be fixed there.

## The window and the tray

Closing the window destroys it and its webviews, so they hold no memory while the app sits in
the tray. The tray menu shows what the app is connected to, and has "Open pluxy" (a new window)
and "Quit pluxy". In managed mode, "Start core", "Stop core" and "Restart core" control only the
core the app started. They work with the window closed and no renderer running. These actions
are disabled in local and remote modes; the native side also refuses lifecycle requests there.

When an owned core exits unexpectedly, the app retries after 2, 5 and 15 seconds, with at most
three recovery attempts in a rolling five-minute window. Successful and manual restarts keep
that budget. After the third failed recovery or another crash within that window, the tray
shows "Core recovery paused" and the Connection page shows the reason. "Start core" explicitly
tries again. A manual Stop, a mode change or a newer Start cancels scheduled recovery. An
intentional Stop stays stopped. If the app cannot make its tray icon, closing the window quits the app.

## Commands

The window's webview, labelled `main`, is the only webview any capability names
(`src-tauri/capabilities/main.json`). Every app command is declared in the app's command
manifest (`src-tauri/build.rs`, from the list in `src-tauri/src/command_names.rs`). With a
manifest, Tauri checks every call against the capabilities, also from the app's own pages;
without one, a webview with no capability that shows a page from the app could call any command.
The grant names the webview, not the window: a grant for the window would also cover the
extension page webviews inside it. Each command also refuses any caller but `main`.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `connection_get` | The connection, without the key |
| `connection_set` | Changes the mode, address, key, certificate file or core program |
| `core_restart` | Starts the app's own core again (managed mode) |
| `core_call` | One management API call to the connected core |
| `sign_in`, `sign_out` | Checks and keeps a key, or forgets it (local and remote modes) |
| `page_open`, `page_place`, `page_close` | Opens an extension page's webview over part of the window, moves it, closes it |
| `page_send` | Passes the window's channel messages to a page's webview |

The window may also listen to the app's events. To add a command: add it to
`command_names.rs`, to `generate_handler!` in `lib.rs`, and its `allow-<name>` permission to
`capabilities/main.json`. The unit tests check that these three agree.

## Extension pages

Each extension page the window shows gets a webview of its own (`page-<n>`), placed over the
page area. No capability names that webview, so it can call no app command and no Tauri plugin.
It has a web context of its own, apart from the window's storage, kept in the app's cache folder
and cleared at each start. It may show only the app's page document and the pages site.

On Linux, Tauri stacks a window's webviews one under another in a box and ignores where they
should be, so the app lays them out itself: it moves the window's webview into a GTK overlay and
puts each page webview over it at the page area (`src-tauri/src/place.rs`).

That webview loads one app document from the `pluxy-page:` scheme (`page/`). The document shows
the extension's page in a frame with `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, from core's pages site, as the
panel does, and does the panel's side of the page's hello
([extension pages](../ui/extension-pages/README.md)). Its `/send` address is the webview's one
way out: the native side tags each message with the webview it came from and passes it to the
window, which answers with the kit's channel, bound to the extension core lists the page under.
So a page gets the same checks, permissions and limits as in the panel, and never the key.

## Build and check

Bun `1.4.3`, a stable Rust toolchain (CI uses 1.97.0), and on Linux the WebKitGTK 4.1 and
libayatana-appindicator development packages. The app builds the kit from `../ui`, so install
that first. From this folder:

```bash
(cd ../ui && bun install --frozen-lockfile)
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check          # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint           # Biome
bun run test           # unit tests
bun run build          # the window, into dist/, which the native build embeds
cd src-tauri
cargo test --locked    # unit tests, and each mode against a real core (needs Go)
cargo build --release  # target/release/pluxy-app
```

`cargo test` runs `tests/modes.rs`: each mode against a real core with fake extensions,
started by `go run ./e2e/panelcore` from `next/`, on random loopback ports in temporary folders.

`bun run test:native` runs the native test: it builds the app with the `native-test` feature
and runs it on a private X server (`xvfb-run`) with a private session bus (`dbus-run-session`),
a fresh HOME and XDG folders, once in each mode. In each it checks that the window's webview
reaches every command, that at the top of an extension page's webview Tauri refuses every app
command and the plugin commands tried, that the app reaches no command from that webview, that
nothing reaches the app from the page's frame, that the page webview covers the page area, that
closing the window leaves no webview and
no web process, and that quitting stops only the app's own core. With the window closed, it
finds the app's real StatusNotifierItem through the session's tray watcher and sends the actual
Start/Stop/Restart menu events over com.canonical.dbusmenu. It kills only the reported owned
core as an on-demand crash fixture, checks recovery and the three-attempt cutoff, checks that
a pending recovery cannot undo manual Stop, and checks that local/remote tray actions cannot
control a foreign core. Every tray operation asserts zero renderer processes and webviews. The `native-test` feature is
for that test alone; release builds never have it.

Before the app, each run's session starts desktop services (`native/session.ts`, with the
packages and paths in `native/services.ts`) and checks them for real; a missing or broken one
fails the run at setup, naming its package, and never skips:

- the portal frontend with the gtk backend (`portals.conf` in the run's own config folder selects
  it), which start the document portal and the permission store. A random file goes to the
  document portal over D-Bus with a file descriptor (the probe `src-tauri/examples/session_probe.rs`,
  built with gio, since gdbus and busctl cannot pass descriptors) and its bytes are read back
  through the portal's mount;
- the tray watcher service, which owns `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher`: the probe registers a
  status notifier item with it and finds the item in `RegisteredStatusNotifierItems`;
- a disposable AppImage, built from a pinned release of the AppImage type 2 runtime (downloaded
  into `~/.cache/pluxy-app-native`, its SHA-256 checked; `mksquashfs` builds the image), which runs
  with `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`, the FUSE-free way to run an AppImage, in the run's cleared
  environment. It is a fixture, not the app's own package.

When the app has exited, the session stops what it started. On Ubuntu 24.04 the packages are
`xdg-desktop-portal` (frontend, document portal, permission store), `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`,
`ayatana-indicator-application` and `squashfs-tools`; the document portal also needs FUSE
(`/dev/fuse`, `fusermount3`). CI installs them on a pinned `ubuntu-24.04` runner.

## Limits

- Tested on Linux only. On Windows the page document's address is
  `http://pluxy-page.localhost/`; neither Windows nor macOS has been run.
- No installer or bundled core yet (`bundle.active` is off).
- Recovery history lasts for the current app process; quitting the app ends its recovery window.
  A supervisor thread starts the core and stays until it exits, since on Linux the parent-death
  signal follows the thread that started it.
- Keys are typed into the window, which holds them until it hands them to the native side; a
  native entry dialog would keep them out of the webview entirely.
- A kept key is stored in `connection.json`, not in the system keyring.
- The Linux native test uses a real tray watcher and D-Bus menu. Icon placement and interaction
  on other desktop tray hosts have not been checked. The native test's
  session has a real tray watcher, but only a probe item is registered with it, not the app's own
  icon.
- The native test needs the desktop services above, and the pinned AppImage runtime from
  github.com (or a copy in its cache folder), so it does not run offline on a bare machine.
- An extension page's frame can post messages to WebKit's message handler for the webview; Tauri
  refuses them (the native test checks that no command is reached), but they are not filtered
  before that.
